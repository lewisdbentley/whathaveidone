title: I created an interval ear training game
---

I created <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/interval-training-js.html">this</a> game to improve my coding and piano skills.

I'm quite pleased with how this project turned out. But there are definitely some improvements which could and should be made.

* Change 'identical' to 'unison' .
* Make the play button more obvious, with a border and background color.
* Separate next button from answer butons  with different colour and top margin. Pressing next should also automatically play the next notes.
* A feature where the game plays a scale, shows some intervals from the scale and asks questions from the scale.
* Add different sound samples e.g. guitar sounds.
* Allow the user to select harmonic or melodic intervals.
* Add levels.
    * Level 1: Perfect intervals.
    * Level 2: 3rds and 6ths.
    * Level 3: combines levels one and two.
    * level 4: 2nds and 7ths.
    * Level 5: Brings everything together and adds the tritone.
