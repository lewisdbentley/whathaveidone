I"@<p>I followed <a href="https://github.com/kubowania">Ania Kubow</a>’s tutorial to create a simple game of tetris in the browser. <a href="/tetris-js.html">Here</a> it is.</p>

<p>“Tetris came along early and had a very important role in breaking down ordinary people’s inhibitions in front of computers, which were scary objects to non-professionals used to pen and paper. But the fact that something so simple and beautiful could appear on screen destroyed that barrier.” – Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov</p>

<p>Maybe in the future I will make it look pretty.</p>
