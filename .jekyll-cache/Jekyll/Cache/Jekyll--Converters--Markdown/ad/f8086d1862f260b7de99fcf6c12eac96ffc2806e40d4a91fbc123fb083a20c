I"Ü<p>I created <a href="/interval-training-js.html">this</a> game to improve my coding and piano skills.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m quite pleased with how this project turned out. But there are definitely some improvements which could and should be made.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change â€˜identicalâ€™ to â€˜unisonâ€™ .</li>
  <li>Make the play button more obvious, with a border and background color.</li>
  <li>Separate next button from answer butons  with different colour and top margin. Pressing next should also automatically play the next notes.</li>
  <li>A feature where the game plays a scale, shows some intervals from the scale and asks questions from the scale.</li>
  <li>Add different sound samples e.g. guitar sounds.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to select harmonic or melodic intervals.</li>
  <li>Add levels.
    <ul>
      <li>Level 1: Perfect intervals.</li>
      <li>Level 2: 3rds and 6ths.</li>
      <li>Level 3: combines levels one and two.</li>
      <li>level 4: 2nds and 7ths.</li>
      <li>Level 5: Brings everything together and adds the tritone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
